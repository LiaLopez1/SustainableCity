An SDG-Inspired Environmental Transformation Experience

In Green Rise, players embark on a transformative journey through polluted cities, working toward restoring urban environments by promoting sustainability and recycling. Inspired by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 11, 12, and 13, the game encourages environmental awareness, responsible consumption, and climate action through engaging mechanics and gradual city revitalization.

The game goes beyond simulation by integrating real-world lessons on recycling practices, resource management, and the long-term effects of pollution, encouraging climate awareness and eco-conscious decision making.
